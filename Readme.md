#### Using Object Constructors and Prototypes

Dogs are Brit's favorite.

#####Constructors

Constructors create instances of objects.

Be mindful of safe mode and strict mode inconsistencies when using 'this.'
In this assignment, 'this' stayed in the constructor  and so referred to the instance being created.

I defined methods inside of constructor instead of in the prototype where functions don't have to exists in every instance of an object and run unnecessarily. Data for constructors. Methods for prototypes.
